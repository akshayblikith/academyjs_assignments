        <h1>Section 2 - Basic HTML Elements</h1>

    <p>
        Technically, you can structure your content with just the div tag. But you should remember that your content is
        not only consumed by humans, but also by software tools like crawlers. Using tags to specify semantic
        information helps these tools understand your content better. For example, using keywords in heading tags is a
        known technique to improve your site's SEO.

    <p>
        We will learn about different HTML elements and their use cases in this chapter.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Block-Level and Inline-Level Elements
    </h2>
    <p>In HTML, elements are categorized as either block-level elements or inline-level elements.</p>
    <p>A block-level element occupies 100% width of the parent element. Its height is equal to its content. Further, the
        browser adds a newline before and after the block. These are the default styles for a block-level element, but
        you can modify them using CSS.</p>
    <p>To visualize a block-level element, open the following document in your browser:</p>
    <p>Block-level elements can appear only inside the `body` element. You cannot use it inside the `head` element. Some
        examples of block-level elements include: div, code, blockquote, address, article, form, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>An inline-level element on the other hand occupies both the width and the height equal to its content. It does
        not start a newline. Again, these are the default styles for an inline-level element, but you can modify them
        using CSS.
    </p>
    <p>In general, you should put only inline-level elements or data in inline-level elements. You should not put
        block-level elements.
    </p>
    <h2>Paragraph</h2>
    <p>The `p` element creates a paragraph of text. It is a block-level element. You can add any inline-level elements
        like `span` and `a`. You cannot add block-level elements or nest paragraphs.</p>
    <p>Example</p>
    <h2>Line Break</h2>
    <p>The `br` element creates a line break. Can you guess if it is an inline-level element or a block-level element?
        You can use the shorthand syntax with this element.</p>
    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>There are six heading tags: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6. By default, the h1 element is the biggest. The font size is
        decreased as the number increases. Similarly, the importance of the headings decreases from h1 to h6. In other
        words, the h1 element is given the highest importance, while the h6 element is given the least importance.</p>
    <p>The organization of your headings is important for improving your site’s SEO.</p>
    <h2>Italics</h2>
    <p>The `i` element is used to mark text as idiomatic. The text is rendered in italics.</p>
    <h2>Bold</h2>
    <p>The `b` element is used to mark text to draw the reader’s attention. Before HTML4, this element was used to style
        text in boldface. However, you should use the font-weight CSS property for this.</p>
    <h2>The Anchor Element</h2>
    <p>When the user clicks on the hyperlink, the link opens in the current browser tab by default. To change this
        behavior, you need to specify the `target` attribute like this:
        <code><a href=”https://academyjs.com” target=”_blank”>Open AcademyJS<a></code>
    </p>
    <h2>Assignments</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Read the notes</li>
        <li>Execute and play around with the examples</li>
        <li>Convert the notes into an HTML document. Use the most appropriate elements. You do not have to worry about
            the styles right now. The idea of this assignment is to help you internalize the appropriate usage of
            elements.</li>
        <li>Is `br` an inline-level element or a block-level element?</li>
        <li>Learn about `em`, `mark`, `ins`, `del`, `sup`, `sub`, `small`, and `i` elements.</li>
        <li>Learn about `audio` and `video` elements.</li>
    </ul>
